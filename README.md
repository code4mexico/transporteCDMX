### About this project
TransporteCDMX was born in the process of creating a better all-in-one [Mexico City's app](https://adip.cdmx.gob.mx/comunicacion/nota/la-adip-presenta-alameda-central-la-aplicacion-unica-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico). We decided to move out all government services related to transport from App CDMX (formerly Alameda Central). We believe that you will only create high quality products if your problem is framed.

### Code for Mexico
We are in the process of creating our NGO in the meanwhile we will fulfill our objective under this name. We are mainly developers and designers that uses code and design to change Mexico's social problems. We know that our social problems need multidisciplinary solutions so we are not closed to other professional profiles, but a collaboration depends if your profile matches one of our current projects.

We work under one philosophy: Deliver high quality products. The main reason this project is alive is because government solutions lack of quality. We know government has a big challenge and the first one they need to solve is professional abilities and capabilities. That's why we are here to help. 

If you feel you work under the same philosophy and you want to push forward on your senior abilities please send us an email: [kernel@codeformexico.com](mailto://kernel@codeformexico.com).

### Analytics we generate
We only gather app usage information to improve our app. We will only use generated data only with that purpose.
We don't gather any user's sensitive information like: email, names, phone numbers, etc. If you have any doubt you can
contact us or check our code. We might open source this information in the future.

### About our endpoints
We use Mexico City's open data to create this app and we will never charge to obtain any information. For now we will not expose freely any information related to [endpoints file](src/api/endpoints.js).
Our main reason is because Mexico City's capacity is under its optimal capacity. If we expose our endpoints we will kill government services ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯, sorry.
We want to this project to be alive for many years so we will respect all the developers that work at Mexico City's government.
Just put yourself in their position. You don't want any ugly boss yelling at you because city services are down.

On the other hand, you can find our mocks endpoints in our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you create other open source solution with this information we will evaluate along with the government if we can give you access to our endpoints.
